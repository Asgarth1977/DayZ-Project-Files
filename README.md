# Dayz Project Files

This is just a project i am working on.

The files are not mine, however i am altering them to suit our server needs.

All proper cudos will be given to their respective owners of each and every addition i will be adding to our server.

Server official owner: Roadsoldier aka Marko
Server Unofficial Editor: Asgarth1977 aka Michael
Server commits will not be granted unless extensively tested before being put on to the live server.

All files that are created from this day forth, will solely be for our server purposes, if you would like to use our server files, you are granted to do so under the GNU license free of charge, however.... the addons and alterations will have to publicely addressed when using our files.

All addons that are not ours, but we were allowed to use within our server package, should be publicely addressed to as well and give respect to their creators.

Our first respect token will go out to:
